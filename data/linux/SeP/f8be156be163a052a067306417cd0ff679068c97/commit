    KVM: do not allow mapping valid but non-reference-counted pages
    
    It's possible to create a region which maps valid but non-refcounted
    pages (e.g., tail pages of non-compound higher order allocations). These
    host pages can then be returned by gfn_to_page, gfn_to_pfn, etc., family
    of APIs, which take a reference to the page, which takes it from 0 to 1.
    When the reference is dropped, this will free the page incorrectly.
    
    Fix this by only taking a reference on valid pages if it was non-zero,
    which indicates it is participating in normal refcounting (and can be
    released with put_page).
    
    This addresses CVE-2021-22543.
