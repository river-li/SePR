    [NETFILTER]: Fix do_add_counters race, possible oops or info leak (CVE-2006-0039)
    
    Solar Designer found a race condition in do_add_counters(). The beginning
    of paddc is supposed to be the same as tmp which was sanity-checked
    above, but it might not be the same in reality. In case the integer
    overflow and/or the race condition are triggered, paddc->num_counters
    might not match the allocation size for paddc. If the check below
    (t->private->number != paddc->num_counters) nevertheless passes (perhaps
    this requires the race condition to be triggered), IPT_ENTRY_ITERATE()
    would read kernel memory beyond the allocation size, potentially causing
    an oops or leaking sensitive data (e.g., passwords from host system or
    from another VPS) via counter increments. This requires CAP_NET_ADMIN.
