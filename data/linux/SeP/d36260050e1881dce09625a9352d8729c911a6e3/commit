    Pull media fixes from Mauro Carvalho Chehab:
     "A series of media updates/fixes for 4.17.
    
      There are two important core fix patches in this series:
    
       - A regression fix on Kernel 4.16 with causes it to not work with
         some input devices that depend on media core
    
       - A fix at compat32 bits with causes it to OOPS on overlay, and
         affects the Kernels where the CVE-2017-13166 was backported
    
      The remaining ones are other random fixes at the documentation and on
      drivers.
    
      The biggest part of this series is a set of 18 patches for the Intel
      atomisp driver. Currently, it produces hundreds of warnings/errors on
      sparse/smatch, causing me to sometimes ignore new warnings on other
      drivers that are not so broken. This driver is on really poor state,
      even for staging standards: it has several layers of abstraction on
      it, and it supports two different hardware. Selecting between them
      require to add a define (there isn't even a Kconfig option for such
      purpose). Just on this smatch cleanup, I could easily get rid of 8
      "do-nothing" files. So, I'm seriously considering its removal from
      upstream, if I don't see any real work on addressing the problems
      there along this year"
