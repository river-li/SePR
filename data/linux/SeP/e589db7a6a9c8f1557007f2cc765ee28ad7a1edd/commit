    Pull ext4 fixes from Ted Ts'o:
     "Various bug fixes for ext4.  The most serious of them fixes a security
      bug (CVE-2012-4508) which leads to stale data exposure when we have
      fallocate racing against writes to files undergoing delayed
      allocation.  We also have two fixes for the metadata checksum feature,
      the most serious of which can cause the superblock to have a invalid
      checksum after a power failure."
