    Merge L1 Terminal Fault fixes from Thomas Gleixner:
     "L1TF, aka L1 Terminal Fault, is yet another speculative hardware
      engineering trainwreck. It's a hardware vulnerability which allows
      unprivileged speculative access to data which is available in the
      Level 1 Data Cache when the page table entry controlling the virtual
      address, which is used for the access, has the Present bit cleared or
      other reserved bits set.
    
      If an instruction accesses a virtual address for which the relevant
      page table entry (PTE) has the Present bit cleared or other reserved
      bits set, then speculative execution ignores the invalid PTE and loads
      the referenced data if it is present in the Level 1 Data Cache, as if
      the page referenced by the address bits in the PTE was still present
      and accessible.
    
      While this is a purely speculative mechanism and the instruction will
      raise a page fault when it is retired eventually, the pure act of
      loading the data and making it available to other speculative
      instructions opens up the opportunity for side channel attacks to
      unprivileged malicious code, similar to the Meltdown attack.
    
      While Meltdown breaks the user space to kernel space protection, L1TF
      allows to attack any physical memory address in the system and the
      attack works across all protection domains. It allows an attack of SGX
      and also works from inside virtual machines because the speculation
      bypasses the extended page table (EPT) protection mechanism.
    
      The assoicated CVEs are: CVE-2018-3615, CVE-2018-3620, CVE-2018-3646
    
      The mitigations provided by this pull request include:
    
       - Host side protection by inverting the upper address bits of a non
         present page table entry so the entry points to uncacheable memory.
    
       - Hypervisor protection by flushing L1 Data Cache on VMENTER.
    
       - SMT (HyperThreading) control knobs, which allow to 'turn off' SMT
         by offlining the sibling CPU threads. The knobs are available on
         the kernel command line and at runtime via sysfs
    
       - Control knobs for the hypervisor mitigation, related to L1D flush
         and SMT control. The knobs are available on the kernel command line
         and at runtime via sysfs
    
       - Extensive documentation about L1TF including various degrees of
         mitigations.
    
      Thanks to all people who have contributed to this in various ways -
      patches, review, testing, backporting - and the fruitful, sometimes
      heated, but at the end constructive discussions.
    
      There is work in progress to provide other forms of mitigations, which
      might be less horrible performance wise for a particular kind of
      workloads, but this is not yet ready for consumption due to their
      complexity and limitations"
