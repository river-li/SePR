    Pull networking update from David Miller:
     "A couple weeks of bug fixing in there.  The largest chunk is all the
      broken crap Amerigo Wang found in the netpoll layer."
    
     1) netpoll and it's users has several serious bugs:
        a) uses GFP_KERNEL with locks held
        b) interfaces requiring interrupts disabled are called with them
           enabled
        c) and vice versa
        d) VLAN tag demuxing, as per all other RX packet input paths, is not
           applied
    
        All from Amerigo Wang.
    
     2) Hopefully cure the ipv4 mapped ipv6 address TCP early demux bugs for
        good, from Neal Cardwell.
    
     3) Unlike AF_UNIX, AF_PACKET sockets don't set a default credentials
        when the user doesn't specify one explicitly during sendmsg().
        Instead we attach an empty (zero) SCM credential block which is
        definitely not what we want.  Fix from Eric Dumazet.
    
     4) IPv6 illegally invokes netdevice notifiers with RCU lock held, fix
        from Ben Hutchings.
    
     5) inet_csk_route_child_sock() checks wrong inet options pointer, fix
        from Christoph Paasch.
    
     6) When AF_PACKET is used for transmit, packet loopback doesn't behave
        properly when a socket fanout is enabled, from Eric Leblond.
    
     7) On bluetooth l2cap channel create failure, we leak the socket, from
        Jaganath Kanakkassery.
    
     8) Fix all the netprio file handling bugs found by Al Viro, from John
        Fastabend.
    
     9) Several error return and NULL deref bug fixes in networking drivers
        from Julia Lawall.
    
    10) A large smattering of struct padding et al.  kernel memory leaks to
        userspace found of Mathias Krause.
    
    11) Conntrack expections in netfilter can access an uninitialized timer,
        fix from Pablo Neira Ayuso.
    
    12) Several netfilter SIP tracker bug fixes from Patrick McHardy.
    
    13) IPSEC ipv6 routes are not initialized correctly all the time,
        resulting in an OOPS in inet_putpeer().  Also from Patrick McHardy.
    
    14) Bridging does rcu_dereference() outside of RCU protected area, from
        Stephen Hemminger.
    
    15) Fix routing cache removal performance regression when looking up
        output routes that have a local destination.  From Zheng Yan.
