    ====================
    pull-request: bpf-next 2018-09-25
    
    The following pull-request contains BPF updates for your *net-next* tree.
    
    The main changes are:
    
    1) Allow for RX stack hardening by implementing the kernel's flow
       dissector in BPF. Idea was originally presented at netconf 2017 [0].
       Quote from merge commit:
    
         [...] Because of the rigorous checks of the BPF verifier, this
         provides significant security guarantees. In particular, the BPF
         flow dissector cannot get inside of an infinite loop, as with
         CVE-2013-4348, because BPF programs are guaranteed to terminate.
         It cannot read outside of packet bounds, because all memory accesses
         are checked. Also, with BPF the administrator can decide which
         protocols to support, reducing potential attack surface. Rarely
         encountered protocols can be excluded from dissection and the
         program can be updated without kernel recompile or reboot if a
         bug is discovered. [...]
    
       Also, a sample flow dissector has been implemented in BPF as part
       of this work, from Petar and Willem.

    2) Add support for bpftool to list currently active attachment
       points of BPF networking programs providing a quick overview
       similar to bpftool's perf subcommand, from Yonghong.
    
    3) Fix a verifier pruning instability bug where a union member
       from the register state was not cleared properly leading to
       branches not being pruned despite them being valid candidates,
       from Alexei.
    
    4) Various smaller fast-path optimizations in XDP's map redirect
       code, from Jesper.
    
    5) Enable to recognize BPF_MAP_TYPE_REUSEPORT_SOCKARRAY maps
       in bpftool, from Roman.
    
    6) Remove a duplicate check in libbpf that probes for function
       storage, from Taeung.
    
    7) Fix an issue in test_progs by avoid checking for errno since
       on success its value should not be checked, from Mauricio.
    
    8) Fix unused variable warning in bpf_getsockopt() helper when
       CONFIG_INET is not configured, from Anders.
    
    9) Fix a compilation failure in the BPF sample code's use of
       bpf_flow_keys, from Prashant.
    
    10) Minor cleanups in BPF code, from Yue and Zhong.
