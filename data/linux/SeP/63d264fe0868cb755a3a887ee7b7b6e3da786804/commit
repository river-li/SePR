    Merge tag 'Intel-CVE-2019-14615' from bundle by Akeem Abodunrin.
    
    Merge Intel Gen9 graphics fix from Akeem Abodunrin:
     "Insufficient control flow in certain data structures for some Intel
      Processors with Intel Processor Graphics may allow an unauthenticated
      user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access
    
      This provides mitigation for Gen9 hardware. Note that Gen8 is not
      impacted due to a previously implemented workaround.
    
      The mitigation involves using an existing hardware feature to forcibly
      clear down all EU state at each context switch"
