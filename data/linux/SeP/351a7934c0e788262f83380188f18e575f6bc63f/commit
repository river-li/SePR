    Pull CIFS fixes from Steve French:
     "Three cifs fixes, the most important fixing the problem with passing
      bogus pointers with writev (CVE-2014-0069).
    
      Two additional cifs fixes are still in review (including the fix for
      an append problem which Al also discovered)"
    
    * 'for-linus' of git://git.samba.org/sfrench/cifs-2.6:
      CIFS: Fix too big maxBuf size for SMB3 mounts
      cifs: ensure that uncached writes handle unmapped areas correctly
      [CIFS] Fix cifsacl mounts over smb2 to not call cifs
