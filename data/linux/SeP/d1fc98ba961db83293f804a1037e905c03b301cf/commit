    Merge branch 'x86/urgent' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip
    
    Pull x86 fixes from Peter Anvin:
     "A pile of fixes related to the VDSO, EFI and 32-bit badsys handling.
    
      It turns out that removing the section headers from the VDSO breaks
      gdb, so this puts back most of them.  A very simple typo broke
      rt_sigreturn on some versions of glibc, with obviously disastrous
      results.  The rest is pretty much fixes for the corresponding fallout.
    
      The EFI fixes fixes an arithmetic overflow on 32-bit systems and
      quiets some build warnings.
    
      Finally, when invoking an invalid system call number on x86-32, we
      bypass a bunch of handling, which can make the audit code oops"
