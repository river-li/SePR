    Pull second batch of KVM updates from Radim Krčmář:
     "General:
    
       - move kvm_stat tool from QEMU repo into tools/kvm/kvm_stat (kvm_stat
         had nothing to do with QEMU in the first place -- the tool only
         interprets debugfs)
    
       - expose per-vm statistics in debugfs and support them in kvm_stat
         (KVM always collected per-vm statistics, but they were summarised
         into global statistics)
    
      x86:
    
       - fix dynamic APICv (VMX was improperly configured and a guest could
         access host's APIC MSRs, CVE-2016-4440)
    
       - minor fixes
    
      ARM changes from Christoffer Dall:
    
       - new vgic reimplementation of our horribly broken legacy vgic
         implementation.  The two implementations will live side-by-side
         (with the new being the configured default) for one kernel release
         and then we'll remove the legacy one.
    
       - fix for a non-critical issue with virtual abort injection to guests"
