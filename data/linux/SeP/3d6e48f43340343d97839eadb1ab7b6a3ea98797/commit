    [S390] CVE-2008-1514: prevent ptrace padding area read/write in 31-bit mode
    
    When running a 31-bit ptrace, on either an s390 or s390x kernel,
    reads and writes into a padding area in struct user_regs_struct32
    will result in a kernel panic.
    
    This is also known as CVE-2008-1514.
    
    Test case available here:
    http://sources.redhat.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/~checkout~/tests/ptrace-tests/tests/user-area-padding.c?cvsroot=systemtap
    
    Steps to reproduce:
    1) wget the above
    2) gcc -o user-area-padding-31bit user-area-padding.c -Wall -ggdb2 -D_GNU_SOURCE -m31
    3) ./user-area-padding-31bit
    <panic>
    
    Test status
    -----------
    Without patch, both s390 and s390x kernels panic. With patch, the test case,
    as well as the gdb testsuite, pass without incident, padding area reads
    returning zero, writes ignored.
    
    Nb: original version returned -EINVAL on write attempts, which broke the
    gdb test and made the test case slightly unhappy, Jan Kratochvil suggested
    the change to return 0 on write attempts.
