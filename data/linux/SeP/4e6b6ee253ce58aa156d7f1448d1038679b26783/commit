    Merge tag 'md/4.2-rc5-fixes' of git://neil.brown.name/md
    
    Pull md fixes from Neil Brown:
     "Three more fixes for md in 4.2
    
      Mostly corner-case stuff.
    
      One of these patches is for a CVE: CVE-2015-5697
    
      I'm not convinced it is serious (data leak from CAP_SYS_ADMIN ioctl)
      but as people seem to want to back-port it, I've included a minimal
      version here.  The remainder of that patch from Benjamin is
      code-cleanup and will arrive in the 4.3 merge window"
    
    * tag 'md/4.2-rc5-fixes' of git://neil.brown.name/md:
      md/raid5: don't let shrink_slab shrink too far.
      md: use kzalloc() when bitmap is disabled
      md/raid1: extend spinlock to protect raid1_end_read_request against inconsistencies
