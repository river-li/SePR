This folder contains manual analysis results for vulnerability patches.

For each patch here, I have analyzed something like **vulnerability root cause**, **fixing methods**, **inducing commits**, **fixing commits**, **vulnerability type**.

We seperate fixing methods as three main categories:
- Fix the vulnerable operation
- Add operation checks
- Fix the triggering operation
